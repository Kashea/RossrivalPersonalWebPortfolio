Good day everyone! Today, I'd like to take a few moments to present my personal website. You can find it at https://kashea.github.io/webportfolio/.

First, let's talk about the layout of the website. I've organized it into several sections, including a header section with my name and navigation links, an "About Me" section with some background information, a "Skills" section that lists my relevant skills and experience, and a "Projects" section that showcases some of my past work. I've also included a footer section with my contact information.

I've used Bootstrap for most of the styling, which helps to ensure a consistent look and feel throughout the website. But I've also added my own personal touch to the website to make it stand out. For example, in the header section, I've used a bold and striking font for my name, which helps to make it stand out and grab the user's attention. I've also added a subtle gradient effect to the background, which adds depth and visual interest without being too distracting.

Now, let's talk about the animations. I believe that motion can be a powerful tool for drawing the user's attention and guiding them through the website. One example of this is the navigation bar, which features a smooth and elegant hover effect. When the user hovers over a link, the text gently fades from white to black, which helps to highlight the selected link.

Another example of animation on the website is in the "Projects" section. Each project is displayed as a thumbnail image, which the user can click on to view more details. When the user clicks on an image, it expands to fill the screen, and the surrounding images smoothly fade out. This creates a sense of focus and intimacy, and helps the user to fully engage with the project.

Overall, I believe that the combination of Bootstrap styling and custom animations creates a website that is both visually appealing and functional. From Einstein's perspective, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." I believe that my website strikes a balance between simplicity and elegance, and I hope that you find it as intriguing and inspiring as I do.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my presentation, and I hope you'll take a moment to visit my website and explore it for yourself.
